They direct the Order of Bafalia through oracles and retrieve engrams from the Abaritia sealed away in the Holy Land. However, as a result, the distortion caused by Abaritia accumulated, leading to the destruction of the planet. Erinze wanted to release this cause and effect and explore a new future. Although it was only for a short time, Erinze told me that the trip with them was \"fun\". There was a faint glint in Feste's eyes when he heard that. At the Chronogate on the top floor, Bachelard was waiting. The face was familiar. The man I saw in my dream--the man who took the screaming boy's mother away. As soon as Bachelard glanced at us, he attacked without saying a word. Tiris is also beaten away, and Erinze is put into a coma. And Bachelard took only Erinze and made a chronoleap. A voice from Imagineseed was heard in the place left behind. \"Help Erinze\" \"She will be used in the 'plan'\" The voice does not answer the question. However, Erinze cannot be left alone.

However, this time Tiris is caught by Avalitya Shell. An alarm rang out, and Bashlar gave instructions, but the Avalitya Shell didn't stop moving. Unable to reach Tilith's outstretched hand, she was swallowed by the Avalitya Shell. The next moment, Abaritia Shell emitted a dazzling light and disappeared without a trace. According to Bachelard, Avalitya Shell jumped from here 1000 years ago to their own era. Moreover, the space-time is disturbed by its influence, and it is not possible to chrono-leap and chase it. In the stalemate, Merlouf came along with Hrelbe. After understanding all the circumstances, he said, \"I'll make it possible for Chronoleap.\" Half in doubt, I headed for Chronogate, and indeed the space-time was stable. Chrono Leap is possible with this. Bachelard has proposed a cooperative relationship with the goal of capturing the Abaritia Shell. Erinze seemed emotionally unwilling to nod, but she gave priority to saving Tiris and accepted the proposal. Bachelard's support, such as the preparation of the chronogram, was essential for the rescue of Tiris. Leaving Hrelbe on guard, I performed Chronoleap with Erinze again. Our destination is our time.

Of course, there were many opposing opinions, and in the end it was decided that Erinze would release Avalitya. However, even that was Bachelard's speculation. As a result of releasing Abaritia and activating the biometric engram, Erinze was in a state where it was easier to fuse with the Abaritia shell.
